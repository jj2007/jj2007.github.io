          Hooks are a new addition in React 16.8. They let you use state and
          other React features without writing a class.
        </p>
        <pre><code>import React, { useState } from 'react';

          function Example() {
            // Declare a new state variable, which we'll call "count"
            const [count, setCount] = <b>useState(0)</b>;
          
            return (
              &ltdiv&gt
                &ltp&gtYou clicked {count} times&lt/p&gt
                &ltbutton onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}&gt
                  Click me
                &lt/button&gt
              &lt/div&gt
            );
          }</code></pre>
        <p>
          We‚Äôve often had to maintain components that started out simple but
          grew into an unmanageable mess of stateful logic and side effects.
          Each lifecycle method often contains a mix of unrelated logic. For
          example, components might perform some data fetching in
          <b>componentDidMount</b> and <b>componentDidUpdate</b>. However, the
          same <b>componentDidMount</b> method might also contain some unrelated
          logic that sets up event listeners, with cleanup performed in
          <b>componentWillUnmount</b>. Mutually related code that changes
          together gets split apart, but completely unrelated code ends up
          combined in a single method. This makes it too easy to introduce bugs
          and inconsistencies. In many cases it‚Äôs not possible to break these
          components into smaller ones because the stateful logic is all over
          the place. It‚Äôs also difficult to test them. This is one of the
          reasons many people prefer to combine React with a separate state
          management library. However, that often introduces too much
          abstraction, requires you to jump between different files, and makes
          reusing components more difficult. To solve this, Hooks let you split
          one component into smaller functions based on what pieces are related
          (such as setting up a subscription or fetching data), rather than
          forcing a split based on lifecycle methods. You may also opt into
          managing the component‚Äôs local state with a reducer to make it more
          predictable.

          Hooks are a new addition in React 16.8. They let you use state and
          other React features without writing a class. This example renders a
          counter. When you click the button, it increments the value. Hooks are
          functions that let you ‚Äúhook into‚Äù React state and lifecycle features
          from function components. Hooks don‚Äôt work inside classes ‚Äî they let
          you use React without classes. (We don‚Äôt recommend rewriting your
          existing components overnight but you can start using Hooks in the new
          ones if you‚Äôd like.) React provides a few built-in Hooks like
          useState. You can also create your own Hooks to reuse stateful
          behavior between different components. We‚Äôll look at the built-in
          Hooks first.
        </p>
        <ul><li>
        <h2>üìå State Hook</h2>
        This example renders a counter. When you click the button, it increments
        the value:
        <pre><code>
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Example() {
  // Declare a new state variable, which we'll call "count"
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    &ltdiv>
      &ltp>You clicked {count} times &lt/p>
      &ltbutton onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      &lt/button>
    &lt/div>
  );
}
        </code></pre>
        <p>
          Here, <b>useState</b> is a Hook (we‚Äôll talk about what this means in a
          moment). We call it inside a function component to add some local
          state to it. React will preserve this state between re-renders.
          useState returns a pair: the current state value and a function that
          lets you update it. You can call this function from an event handler
          or somewhere else. It‚Äôs similar to this.setState in a class, except it
          doesn‚Äôt merge the old and new state together. The only argument to
          useState is the initial state. In the example above, it is 0 because
          our counter starts from zero. Note that unlike this.state, the state
          here doesn‚Äôt have to be an object ‚Äî although it can be if you want.
          The initial state argument is only used during the first render.
          Declaring multiple state variables You can use the State Hook more
          than once in a single component:
        </p>

        <pre><code>
function ExampleWithManyStates() {
  // Declare multiple state variables!
  const [age, setAge] = useState(42);
  const [fruit, setFruit] = useState('banana');
  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([{ text: 'Learn Hooks' }]);
  // ...
}
</code></pre>
        <p>
          The array destructuring syntax lets us give different names to the
          state variables we declared by calling useState. These names aren‚Äôt a
          part of the useState API. Instead, React assumes that if you call
          useState many times, you do it in the same order during every render.
          We‚Äôll come back to why this works and when this is useful later.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>But what is a Hook?</h3>
        <p>
          Hooks are functions that let you ‚Äúhook into‚Äù React state and lifecycle
          features from function components. Hooks don‚Äôt work inside classes ‚Äî
          they let you use React without classes. (We don‚Äôt recommend rewriting
          your existing components overnight but you can start using Hooks in
          the new ones if you‚Äôd like.) React provides a few built-in Hooks like
          useState. You can also create your own Hooks to reuse stateful
          behavior between different components. We‚Äôll look at the built-in
          Hooks first.
        </p>

        <h2>‚ö°Ô∏è Effect Hook</h2>
        <p>
          You‚Äôve likely performed data fetching, subscriptions, or manually
          changing the DOM from React components before. We call these
          operations ‚Äúside effects‚Äù (or ‚Äúeffects‚Äù for short) because they can
          affect other components and can‚Äôt be done during rendering. The Effect
          Hook, useEffect, adds the ability to perform side effects from a
          function component. It serves the same purpose as componentDidMount,
          componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount in React classes, but
          unified into a single API. (We‚Äôll show examples comparing useEffect to
          these methods in Using the Effect Hook.) For example, this component
          sets the document title after React updates the DOM:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function Example() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  // Similar to componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate:
  useEffect(() => {
    // Update the document title using the browser API
    document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
  });

  return (
    &ltdiv>
      &ltp>You clicked {count} times&lt/p>
      ltbutton onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      &lt/ltbutton>
    &lt/div>
  );
}
</code></pre>
        <p>
          When you call useEffect, you‚Äôre telling React to run your ‚Äúeffect‚Äù
          function after flushing changes to the DOM. Effects are declared
          inside the component so they have access to its props and state. By
          default, React runs the effects after every render ‚Äî including the
          first render. Effects may also optionally specify how to ‚Äúclean up‚Äù
          after them by returning a function. For example, this component uses
          an effect to subscribe to a friend‚Äôs online status, and cleans up by
          unsubscribing from it:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function FriendStatus(props) {
  const [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(null);

  function handleStatusChange(status) {
    setIsOnline(status.isOnline);
  }

  useEffect(() => {
    ChatAPI.subscribeToFriendStatus(props.friend.id, handleStatusChange);

    return () => {
      ChatAPI.unsubscribeFromFriendStatus(props.friend.id, handleStatusChange);
    };
  });

  if (isOnline === null) {
    return 'Loading...';
  }
  return isOnline ? 'Online' : 'Offline';
}
</code></pre>
        <p>
          In this example, React would unsubscribe from our ChatAPI when the
          component unmounts, as well as before re-running the effect due to a
          subsequent render. (If you want, there‚Äôs a way to tell React to skip
          re-subscribing if the props.friend.id we passed to ChatAPI didn‚Äôt
          change.) Just like with useState, you can use more than a single
          effect in a component:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
function FriendStatusWithCounter(props) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
  });

  const [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(null);
  useEffect(() => {
    ChatAPI.subscribeToFriendStatus(props.friend.id, handleStatusChange);
    return () => {
      ChatAPI.unsubscribeFromFriendStatus(props.friend.id, handleStatusChange);
    };
  });

  function handleStatusChange(status) {
    setIsOnline(status.isOnline);
  }
  </code></pre>
        <p>
          // ... Hooks let you organize side effects in a component by what
          pieces are related (such as adding and removing a subscription),
          rather than forcing a split based on lifecycle methods.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>‚úåÔ∏è Rules of Hooks</h3>
        <p>
          Hooks are JavaScript functions, but they impose two additional rules:
          Only call Hooks at the top level. Don‚Äôt call Hooks inside loops,
          conditions, or nested functions. Only call Hooks from React function
          components. Don‚Äôt call Hooks from regular JavaScript functions. (There
          is just one other valid place to call Hooks ‚Äî your own custom Hooks.
          We‚Äôll learn about them in a moment.) We provide a linter plugin to
          enforce these rules automatically. We understand these rules might
          seem limiting or confusing at first, but they are essential to making
          Hooks work well.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>üí° Building Your Own Hooks</h3>
        <p>
          Sometimes, we want to reuse some stateful logic between components.
          Traditionally, there were two popular solutions to this problem:
          higher-order components and render props. Custom Hooks let you do
          this, but without adding more components to your tree. Earlier on this
          page, we introduced a FriendStatus component that calls the useState
          and useEffect Hooks to subscribe to a friend‚Äôs online status. Let‚Äôs
          say we also want to reuse this subscription logic in another
          component. First, we‚Äôll extract this logic into a custom Hook called
          useFriendStatus:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function useFriendStatus(friendID) {
  const [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(null);

  function handleStatusChange(status) {
    setIsOnline(status.isOnline);
  }

  useEffect(() => {
    ChatAPI.subscribeToFriendStatus(friendID, handleStatusChange);
    return () => {
      ChatAPI.unsubscribeFromFriendStatus(friendID, handleStatusChange);
    };
  });

  return isOnline;
}
</code></pre>
        <p>
          It takes friendID as an argument, and returns whether our friend is
          online. Now we can use it from both components:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
function FriendStatus(props) {
  const isOnline = useFriendStatus(props.friend.id);

  if (isOnline === null) {
    return 'Loading...';
  }
  return isOnline ? 'Online' : 'Offline';
}
function FriendListItem(props) {
  const isOnline = useFriendStatus(props.friend.id);

  return (
    &ltli style={{ color: isOnline ? 'green' : 'black' }}>
      {props.friend.name}
    &lt/li>
  );
}
</code></pre>
        <p>
          The state of these components is completely independent. Hooks are a
          way to reuse stateful logic, not state itself. In fact, each call to a
          Hook has a completely isolated state ‚Äî so you can even use the same
          custom Hook twice in one component. Custom Hooks are more of a
          convention than a feature. If a function‚Äôs name starts with ‚Äùuse‚Äù and
          it calls other Hooks, we say it is a custom Hook. The useSomething
          naming convention is how our linter plugin is able to find bugs in the
          code using Hooks. You can write custom Hooks that cover a wide range
          of use cases like form handling, animation, declarative subscriptions,
          timers, and probably many more we haven‚Äôt considered. We are excited
          to see what custom Hooks the React community will come up with.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>üîå Other Hooks</h2>
        <p>
          There are a few less commonly used built-in Hooks that you might find
          useful. For example, useContext lets you subscribe to React context
          without introducing nesting:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
function Example() {
  const locale = useContext(LocaleContext);
  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
  // ...
}
</code></pre>
        <p>
          And useReducer lets you manage local state of complex components with
          a reducer:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
function Todos() {
  const [todos, dispatch] = useReducer(todosReducer);
  // ...
</code></pre>
</li></ul>

      <header>Using the State Hook</header>
      <article>
        <h3>What is a Hook?</h3>
        <p>
          A Hook is a special function that lets you ‚Äúhook into‚Äù React features.
          For example, useState is a Hook that lets you add React state to
          function components. We‚Äôll learn other Hooks later.
        </p>
        <h3>When would I use a Hook?</h3>
        <p>
          If you write a function component and realize you need to add some
          state to it, previously you had to convert it to a class. Now you can
          use a Hook inside the existing function component. We‚Äôre going to do
          that right now!
        </p>

        <h3>Declaring a State Variable</h3>
        <p>
          In a class, we initialize the count state to 0 by setting this.state
          to { count: 0 } in the constructor:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
        class Example extends React.Component {
          constructor(props) {
            super(props);
            this.state = {
              count: 0
            };
          }
        </code></pre>

        <p>
          In a function component, we have no this, so we can‚Äôt assign or read
          this.state. Instead, we call the useState Hook directly inside our
          component:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
        import React, { useState } from 'react';
        
        function Example() {
          // Declare a new state variable, which we'll call "count"
          const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
        </code></pre>
        <p>
          What does calling useState do? It declares a ‚Äústate variable‚Äù. Our
          variable is called count but we could call it anything else, like
          banana. This is a way to ‚Äúpreserve‚Äù some values between the function
          calls ‚Äî useState is a new way to use the exact same capabilities that
          this.state provides in a class. Normally, variables ‚Äúdisappear‚Äù when
          the function exits but state variables are preserved by React. What do
          we pass to useState as an argument? The only argument to the
          useState() Hook is the initial state. Unlike with classes, the state
          doesn‚Äôt have to be an object. We can keep a number or a string if
          that‚Äôs all we need. In our example, we just want a number for how many
          times the user clicked, so pass 0 as initial state for our variable.
          (If we wanted to store two different values in state, we would call
          useState() twice.) What does useState return? It returns a pair of
          values: the current state and a function that updates it. This is why
          we write const [count, setCount] = useState(). This is similar to
          this.state.count and this.setState in a class, except you get them in
          a pair. If you‚Äôre not familiar with the syntax we used, we‚Äôll come
          back to it at the bottom of this page. Now that we know what the
          useState Hook does, our example should make more sense:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
        import React, { useState } from 'react';
        
        function Example() {
          // Declare a new state variable, which we'll call "count"
          const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
        </code></pre>
        <p>
          We declare a state variable called count, and set it to 0. React will
          remember its current value between re-renders, and provide the most
          recent one to our function. If we want to update the current count, we
          can call setCount. ‚ÄúCreate‚Äù wouldn‚Äôt be quite accurate because the
          state is only created the first time our component renders. During the
          next renders, useState gives us the current state. Otherwise it
          wouldn‚Äôt be ‚Äústate‚Äù at all! There‚Äôs also a reason why Hook names
          always start with use. We‚Äôll learn why later in the Rules of Hooks.
        </p>
        <h3>Reading State</h3>
        <p>
          When we want to display the current count in a class, we read
          this.state.count: // You clicked {this.state.count} times In a
          function, we can use count directly: //You clicked {count} times
        </p>
        <h3>Updating State</h3>
        <p>
          In a class, we need to call this.setState() to update the count state:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
          &ltbutton onClick={() => this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 })}>
            Click me
            &lt/button>
        In a function, we already have setCount and count as variables so we don‚Äôt need this:
        
        &ltbutton onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
            Click me
          &lt/button>

This snippet is based on the counter example from the previous page, but we added a new feature to it: we set the document title to a custom message including the number of clicks.

Data fetching, setting up a subscription, and manually changing the DOM in React components are all examples of side effects. Whether or not you‚Äôre used to calling these operations ‚Äúside effects‚Äù (or just ‚Äúeffects‚Äù), you‚Äôve likely performed them in your components before.
</p>
<h3>Effects Without Cleanup</h3>
<p>
Sometimes, we want to run some additional code after React has updated the DOM. Network requests, manual DOM mutations, and logging are common examples of effects that don‚Äôt require a cleanup. We say that because we can run them and immediately forget about them. Let‚Äôs compare how classes and Hooks let us express such side effects.
</p>
<h3>Example Using Classes</h3>
<p>
In React class components, the render method itself shouldn‚Äôt cause side effects. It would be too early ‚Äî we typically want to perform our effects after React has updated the DOM.

This is why in React classes, we put side effects into componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate. Coming back to our example, here is a React counter class component that updates the document title right after React makes changes to the DOM:
</p>
<pre><code>
class Example extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      count: 0
    };
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    document.title = `You clicked ${this.state.count} times`;
  }

  componentDidUpdate() {
    document.title = `You clicked ${this.state.count} times`;
  }

  render() {
    return (
      &ltdiv>
      &ltp>You clicked {this.state.count} times</p>
        &ltbutton onClick={() => this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 })}>
          Click me
        &lt/button>
      &lt/div>
    );
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Note how we have to duplicate the code between these two lifecycle methods in class.

This is because in many cases we want to perform the same side effect regardless of whether the component just mounted, or if it has been updated. Conceptually, we want it to happen after every render ‚Äî but React class components don‚Äôt have a method like this. We could extract a separate method but we would still have to call it in two places.

Now let‚Äôs see how we can do the same with the useEffect Hook.

Example Using Hooks
We‚Äôve already seen this example at the top of this page, but let‚Äôs take a closer look at it:
</p>
<pre><code>
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function Example() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
  });

  return (
    &ltdiv>
      &ltp>You clicked {count} times</p>
        &ltbutton onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
          Click me
        &lt/button>
    &lt/div>
  );
}
</code></pre>
<h3>What does useEffect do?</h3> <p>By using this Hook, you tell React that your component needs to do something after render. React will remember the function you passed (we‚Äôll refer to it as our ‚Äúeffect‚Äù), and call it later after performing the DOM updates. In this effect, we set the document title, but we could also perform data fetching or call some other imperative API.

<b>Why is useEffect called inside a component?</b> Placing useEffect inside the component lets us access the count state variable (or any props) right from the effect. We don‚Äôt need a special API to read it ‚Äî it‚Äôs already in the function scope. Hooks embrace JavaScript closures and avoid introducing React-specific APIs where JavaScript already provides a solution.

<b>Does useEffect run after every render?</b> Yes! By default, it runs both after the first render and after every update. (We will later talk about how to customize this.) Instead of thinking in terms of ‚Äúmounting‚Äù and ‚Äúupdating‚Äù, you might find it easier to think that effects happen ‚Äúafter render‚Äù. React guarantees the DOM has been updated by the time it runs the effects.
</p>
<h3>Detailed Explanation</h3>
<p>Now that we know more about effects, these lines should make sense:</p>
<pre><code>
function Example() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
  });
</code></pre>
<p>
We declare the count state variable, and then we tell React we need to use an effect. We pass a function to the useEffect Hook. This function we pass is our effect. Inside our effect, we set the document title using the document.title browser API. We can read the latest count inside the effect because it‚Äôs in the scope of our function. When React renders our component, it will remember the effect we used, and then run our effect after updating the DOM. This happens for every render, including the first one.

Experienced JavaScript developers might notice that the function passed to useEffect is going to be different on every render. This is intentional. In fact, this is what lets us read the count value from inside the effect without worrying about it getting stale. Every time we re-render, we schedule a different effect, replacing the previous one. In a way, this makes the effects behave more like a part of the render result ‚Äî each effect ‚Äúbelongs‚Äù to a particular render. We will see more clearly why this is useful later on this page.
</p>
<h3>Effects with Cleanup</h3>
<p>Earlier, we looked at how to express side effects that don‚Äôt require any cleanup. However, some effects do. For example, we might want to set up a subscription to some external data source. In that case, it is important to clean up so that we don‚Äôt introduce a memory leak! Let‚Äôs compare how we can do it with classes and with Hooks.
</p>
<h3>Example Using Classes</h3>
<p>In a React class, you would typically set up a subscription in componentDidMount, and clean it up in componentWillUnmount. For example, let‚Äôs say we have a ChatAPI module that lets us subscribe to a friend‚Äôs online status. Here‚Äôs how we might subscribe and display that status using a class:
</p>
<pre><code>
class FriendStatus extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { isOnline: null };
    this.handleStatusChange = this.handleStatusChange.bind(this);
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    ChatAPI.subscribeToFriendStatus(
      this.props.friend.id,
      this.handleStatusChange
    );
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    ChatAPI.unsubscribeFromFriendStatus(
      this.props.friend.id,
      this.handleStatusChange
    );
  }

  handleStatusChange(status) {
    this.setState({
      isOnline: status.isOnline
    });
  }

  render() {
    if (this.state.isOnline === null) {
      return 'Loading...';
    }
    return this.state.isOnline ? 'Online' : 'Offline';
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Notice how componentDidMount and componentWillUnmount need to mirror each other. Lifecycle methods force us to split this logic even though conceptually code in both of them is related to the same effect.
<b>Example Using Hooks</b>
Let‚Äôs see how we could write this component with Hooks.

You might be thinking that we‚Äôd need a separate effect to perform the cleanup. But code for adding and removing a subscription is so tightly related that useEffect is designed to keep it together. If your effect returns a function, React will run it when it is time to clean up:
</p>
<pre><code>
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function FriendStatus(props) {
  const [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    function handleStatusChange(status) {
      setIsOnline(status.isOnline);
    }

    ChatAPI.subscribeToFriendStatus(props.friend.id, handleStatusChange);
    // Specify how to clean up after this effect:
    return function cleanup() {
      ChatAPI.unsubscribeFromFriendStatus(props.friend.id, handleStatusChange);
    };
  });

  if (isOnline === null) {
    return 'Loading...';
  }
  return isOnline ? 'Online' : 'Offline';
}
</code></pre>
<p>
Why did we return a function from our effect? This is the optional cleanup mechanism for effects. Every effect may return a function that cleans up after it. This lets us keep the logic for adding and removing subscriptions close to each other. They‚Äôre part of the same effect!

When exactly does React clean up an effect? React performs the cleanup when the component unmounts. However, as we learned earlier, effects run for every render and not just once. This is why React also cleans up effects from the previous render before running the effects next time. We‚Äôll discuss why this helps avoid bugs and how to opt out of this behavior in case it creates performance issues later below.

      <header>Rules of Hooks</header>
      <article>
        <p>Hooks are JavaScript functions, but you need to follow two rules when using them. We provide a linter plugin to enforce these rules automatically:
    
<b>Only Call Hooks at the Top Level</b>
Don‚Äôt call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions. Instead, always use Hooks at the top level of your React function. By following this rule, you ensure that Hooks are called in the same order each time a component renders. That‚Äôs what allows React to correctly preserve the state of Hooks between multiple useState and useEffect calls. (If you‚Äôre curious, we‚Äôll explain this in depth below.)

<b>Only Call Hooks from React Functions</b>
Don‚Äôt call Hooks from regular JavaScript functions. Instead, you can:

‚úÖ Call Hooks from React function components.
‚úÖ Call Hooks from custom Hooks (we‚Äôll learn about them on the next page).
By following this rule, you ensure that all stateful logic in a component is clearly visible from its source code.
</p>
<h3>ESLint Plugin</h3>
<p>We released an ESLint plugin called eslint-plugin-react-hooks that enforces these two rules. You can add this plugin to your project if you‚Äôd like to try it:
</p>
<pre><code>
npm install eslint-plugin-react-hooks --save-dev
// Your ESLint configuration
{
  "plugins": [
    // ...
    "react-hooks"
  ],
  "rules": {
    // ...
    "react-hooks/rules-of-hooks": "error", // Checks rules of Hooks
    "react-hooks/exhaustive-deps": "warn" // Checks effect dependencies
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>
In the future, we intend to include this plugin by default into Create React App and similar toolkits.

You can skip to the next page explaining how to write your own Hooks now. On this page, we‚Äôll continue by explaining the reasoning behind these rules.

Explanation
As we learned earlier, we can use multiple State or Effect Hooks in a single component:
</p>
<pre><code>
function Form() {
  // 1. Use the name state variable
  const [name, setName] = useState('Mary');

  // 2. Use an effect for persisting the form
  useEffect(function persistForm() {
    localStorage.setItem('formData', name);
  });

  // 3. Use the surname state variable
  const [surname, setSurname] = useState('Poppins');

  // 4. Use an effect for updating the title
  useEffect(function updateTitle() {
    document.title = name + ' ' + surname;
  });

  // ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>
So how does React know which state corresponds to which useState call? The answer is that React relies on the order in which Hooks are called. Our example works because the order of the Hook calls is the same on every render:
</p>
<pre><code>
// ------------
// First render
// ------------
useState('Mary')           // 1. Initialize the name state variable with 'Mary'
useEffect(persistForm)     // 2. Add an effect for persisting the form
useState('Poppins')        // 3. Initialize the surname state variable with 'Poppins'
useEffect(updateTitle)     // 4. Add an effect for updating the title

// -------------
// Second render
// -------------
useState('Mary')           // 1. Read the name state variable (argument is ignored)
useEffect(persistForm)     // 2. Replace the effect for persisting the form
useState('Poppins')        // 3. Read the surname state variable (argument is ignored)
useEffect(updateTitle)     // 4. Replace the effect for updating the title

// ...\</code></pre>
<p>As long as the order of the Hook calls is the same between renders, React can associate some local state with each of them. But what happens if we put a Hook call (for example, the persistForm effect) inside a condition?
</p>
<pre><code>
  // üî¥ We're breaking the first rule by using a Hook in a condition
  if (name !== '') {
    useEffect(function persistForm() {
      localStorage.setItem('formData', name);
    });
  }
</code></pre>
<p>
The name !== '' condition is true on the first render, so we run this Hook. However, on the next render the user might clear the form, making the condition false. Now that we skip this Hook during rendering, the order of the Hook calls becomes different:</p>
<pre><code>
useState('Mary')           // 1. Read the name state variable (argument is ignored)
// useEffect(persistForm)  // üî¥ This Hook was skipped!
useState('Poppins')        // üî¥ 2 (but was 3). Fail to read the surname state variable
useEffect(updateTitle)     // üî¥ 3 (but was 4). Fail to replace the effect
</code></pre>
<p>
React wouldn‚Äôt know what to return for the second useState Hook call. React expected that the second Hook call in this component corresponds to the persistForm effect, just like during the previous render, but it doesn‚Äôt anymore. From that point, every next Hook call after the one we skipped would also shift by one, leading to bugs.

This is why Hooks must be called on the top level of our components. If we want to run an effect conditionally, we can put that condition inside our Hook:
</p>
<code><pre>
  useEffect(function persistForm() {
    // üëç We're not breaking the first rule anymore
    if (name !== '') {
      localStorage.setItem('formData', name);
    }
  });
</code></pre>
