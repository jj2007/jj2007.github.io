          Hooks are a new addition in React 16.8. They let you use state and
          other React features without writing a class.
        </p>
        <pre><code>import React, { useState } from 'react';

          function Example() {
            // Declare a new state variable, which we'll call "count"
            const [count, setCount] = <b>useState(0)</b>;
          
            return (
              &ltdiv&gt
                &ltp&gtYou clicked {count} times&lt/p&gt
                &ltbutton onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}&gt
                  Click me
                &lt/button&gt
              &lt/div&gt
            );
          }</code></pre>
        <p>
          We‚Äôve often had to maintain components that started out simple but
          grew into an unmanageable mess of stateful logic and side effects.
          Each lifecycle method often contains a mix of unrelated logic. For
          example, components might perform some data fetching in
          <b>componentDidMount</b> and <b>componentDidUpdate</b>. However, the
          same <b>componentDidMount</b> method might also contain some unrelated
          logic that sets up event listeners, with cleanup performed in
          <b>componentWillUnmount</b>. Mutually related code that changes
          together gets split apart, but completely unrelated code ends up
          combined in a single method. This makes it too easy to introduce bugs
          and inconsistencies. In many cases it‚Äôs not possible to break these
          components into smaller ones because the stateful logic is all over
          the place. It‚Äôs also difficult to test them. This is one of the
          reasons many people prefer to combine React with a separate state
          management library. However, that often introduces too much
          abstraction, requires you to jump between different files, and makes
          reusing components more difficult. To solve this, Hooks let you split
          one component into smaller functions based on what pieces are related
          (such as setting up a subscription or fetching data), rather than
          forcing a split based on lifecycle methods. You may also opt into
          managing the component‚Äôs local state with a reducer to make it more
          predictable.

          Hooks are a new addition in React 16.8. They let you use state and
          other React features without writing a class. This example renders a
          counter. When you click the button, it increments the value. Hooks are
          functions that let you ‚Äúhook into‚Äù React state and lifecycle features
          from function components. Hooks don‚Äôt work inside classes ‚Äî they let
          you use React without classes. (We don‚Äôt recommend rewriting your
          existing components overnight but you can start using Hooks in the new
          ones if you‚Äôd like.) React provides a few built-in Hooks like
          useState. You can also create your own Hooks to reuse stateful
          behavior between different components. We‚Äôll look at the built-in
          Hooks first.
        </p>
        <h2>üìå State Hook</h2>
        This example renders a counter. When you click the button, it increments
        the value:
        <pre><code>
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Example() {
  // Declare a new state variable, which we'll call "count"
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    &ltdiv>
      &ltp>You clicked {count} times &lt/p>
      &ltbutton onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      &lt/button>
    &lt/div>
  );
}
        </code></pre>
        <p>
          Here, <b>useState</b> is a Hook (we‚Äôll talk about what this means in a
          moment). We call it inside a function component to add some local
          state to it. React will preserve this state between re-renders.
          useState returns a pair: the current state value and a function that
          lets you update it. You can call this function from an event handler
          or somewhere else. It‚Äôs similar to this.setState in a class, except it
          doesn‚Äôt merge the old and new state together. The only argument to
          useState is the initial state. In the example above, it is 0 because
          our counter starts from zero. Note that unlike this.state, the state
          here doesn‚Äôt have to be an object ‚Äî although it can be if you want.
          The initial state argument is only used during the first render.
          Declaring multiple state variables You can use the State Hook more
          than once in a single component:
        </p>

        <pre><code>
function ExampleWithManyStates() {
  // Declare multiple state variables!
  const [age, setAge] = useState(42);
  const [fruit, setFruit] = useState('banana');
  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([{ text: 'Learn Hooks' }]);
  // ...
}
</code></pre>
        <p>
          The array destructuring syntax lets us give different names to the
          state variables we declared by calling useState. These names aren‚Äôt a
          part of the useState API. Instead, React assumes that if you call
          useState many times, you do it in the same order during every render.
          We‚Äôll come back to why this works and when this is useful later.
        </p>

        <h3>But what is a Hook?</h3>
        <p>
          Hooks are functions that let you ‚Äúhook into‚Äù React state and lifecycle
          features from function components. Hooks don‚Äôt work inside classes ‚Äî
          they let you use React without classes. (We don‚Äôt recommend rewriting
          your existing components overnight but you can start using Hooks in
          the new ones if you‚Äôd like.) React provides a few built-in Hooks like
          useState. You can also create your own Hooks to reuse stateful
          behavior between different components. We‚Äôll look at the built-in
          Hooks first.
        </p>

        <h2>‚ö°Ô∏è Effect Hook</h2>
        <p>
          You‚Äôve likely performed data fetching, subscriptions, or manually
          changing the DOM from React components before. We call these
          operations ‚Äúside effects‚Äù (or ‚Äúeffects‚Äù for short) because they can
          affect other components and can‚Äôt be done during rendering. The Effect
          Hook, useEffect, adds the ability to perform side effects from a
          function component. It serves the same purpose as componentDidMount,
          componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount in React classes, but
          unified into a single API. (We‚Äôll show examples comparing useEffect to
          these methods in Using the Effect Hook.) For example, this component
          sets the document title after React updates the DOM:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function Example() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  // Similar to componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate:
  useEffect(() => {
    // Update the document title using the browser API
    document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
  });

  return (
    &ltdiv>
      &ltp>You clicked {count} times&lt/p>
      ltbutton onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      &lt/ltbutton>
    &lt/div>
  );
}
</code></pre>
        <p>
          When you call useEffect, you‚Äôre telling React to run your ‚Äúeffect‚Äù
          function after flushing changes to the DOM. Effects are declared
          inside the component so they have access to its props and state. By
          default, React runs the effects after every render ‚Äî including the
          first render. Effects may also optionally specify how to ‚Äúclean up‚Äù
          after them by returning a function. For example, this component uses
          an effect to subscribe to a friend‚Äôs online status, and cleans up by
          unsubscribing from it:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function FriendStatus(props) {
  const [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(null);

  function handleStatusChange(status) {
    setIsOnline(status.isOnline);
  }

  useEffect(() => {
    ChatAPI.subscribeToFriendStatus(props.friend.id, handleStatusChange);

    return () => {
      ChatAPI.unsubscribeFromFriendStatus(props.friend.id, handleStatusChange);
    };
  });

  if (isOnline === null) {
    return 'Loading...';
  }
  return isOnline ? 'Online' : 'Offline';
}
</code></pre>
        <p>
          In this example, React would unsubscribe from our ChatAPI when the
          component unmounts, as well as before re-running the effect due to a
          subsequent render. (If you want, there‚Äôs a way to tell React to skip
          re-subscribing if the props.friend.id we passed to ChatAPI didn‚Äôt
          change.) Just like with useState, you can use more than a single
          effect in a component:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
function FriendStatusWithCounter(props) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
  });

  const [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(null);
  useEffect(() => {
    ChatAPI.subscribeToFriendStatus(props.friend.id, handleStatusChange);
    return () => {
      ChatAPI.unsubscribeFromFriendStatus(props.friend.id, handleStatusChange);
    };
  });

  function handleStatusChange(status) {
    setIsOnline(status.isOnline);
  }
  </code></pre>
        <p>
          // ... Hooks let you organize side effects in a component by what
          pieces are related (such as adding and removing a subscription),
          rather than forcing a split based on lifecycle methods.
        </p>
        <h3>‚úåÔ∏è Rules of Hooks</h3>
        <p>
          Hooks are JavaScript functions, but they impose two additional rules:
          Only call Hooks at the top level. Don‚Äôt call Hooks inside loops,
          conditions, or nested functions. Only call Hooks from React function
          components. Don‚Äôt call Hooks from regular JavaScript functions. (There
          is just one other valid place to call Hooks ‚Äî your own custom Hooks.
          We‚Äôll learn about them in a moment.) We provide a linter plugin to
          enforce these rules automatically. We understand these rules might
          seem limiting or confusing at first, but they are essential to making
          Hooks work well.
        </p>
        <h3>üí° Building Your Own Hooks</h3>
        <p>
          Sometimes, we want to reuse some stateful logic between components.
          Traditionally, there were two popular solutions to this problem:
          higher-order components and render props. Custom Hooks let you do
          this, but without adding more components to your tree. Earlier on this
          page, we introduced a FriendStatus component that calls the useState
          and useEffect Hooks to subscribe to a friend‚Äôs online status. Let‚Äôs
          say we also want to reuse this subscription logic in another
          component. First, we‚Äôll extract this logic into a custom Hook called
          useFriendStatus:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function useFriendStatus(friendID) {
  const [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(null);

  function handleStatusChange(status) {
    setIsOnline(status.isOnline);
  }

  useEffect(() => {
    ChatAPI.subscribeToFriendStatus(friendID, handleStatusChange);
    return () => {
      ChatAPI.unsubscribeFromFriendStatus(friendID, handleStatusChange);
    };
  });

  return isOnline;
}
</code></pre>
        <p>
          It takes friendID as an argument, and returns whether our friend is
          online. Now we can use it from both components:
        </p>

        <p></p>
        <pre><code>
function FriendStatus(props) {
  const isOnline = useFriendStatus(props.friend.id);

  if (isOnline === null) {
    return 'Loading...';
  }
  return isOnline ? 'Online' : 'Offline';
}
function FriendListItem(props) {
  const isOnline = useFriendStatus(props.friend.id);

  return (
    &ltli style={{ color: isOnline ? 'green' : 'black' }}>
      {props.friend.name}
    &lt/li>
  );
}
</code></pre>
        <p>
          The state of these components is completely independent. Hooks are a
          way to reuse stateful logic, not state itself. In fact, each call to a
          Hook has a completely isolated state ‚Äî so you can even use the same
          custom Hook twice in one component. Custom Hooks are more of a
          convention than a feature. If a function‚Äôs name starts with ‚Äùuse‚Äù and
          it calls other Hooks, we say it is a custom Hook. The useSomething
          naming convention is how our linter plugin is able to find bugs in the
          code using Hooks. You can write custom Hooks that cover a wide range
          of use cases like form handling, animation, declarative subscriptions,
          timers, and probably many more we haven‚Äôt considered. We are excited
          to see what custom Hooks the React community will come up with.
        </p>
        <h2>üîå Other Hooks</h2>
        <p>
          There are a few less commonly used built-in Hooks that you might find
          useful. For example, useContext lets you subscribe to React context
          without introducing nesting:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
function Example() {
  const locale = useContext(LocaleContext);
  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
  // ...
}
</code></pre>
        <p>
          And useReducer lets you manage local state of complex components with
          a reducer:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
function Todos() {
  const [todos, dispatch] = useReducer(todosReducer);
  // ...
</code></pre>
